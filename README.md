# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Analysis
## Determining factor that drives the demand on bike share rentals, construct statistical models and then try to make prediction on rentals based on the information

### Introduction :
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

In this project, I'll look at the bike share rental data from "Capital Bikeshare," which started serving Washington, D.C., and the surrounding areas in 2010. Until Citi Bike for New York City began operations in 2013, Capital Bikeshare was the largest bike sharing programme in the United States. Capital Bikeshare began with ten stations and 120 bicycles in Washington, D.C., and has now grown to include over 429 stations and 2500 bicycles, as well as servicing Arlington County, Fairfax County, the City of Alexandria in Virginia, and Montgomery County in Maryland.

### Objective :
My objective of the analysis is to find out the determining factor that drives the demand on bike share rentals, construct statistical models and then try to make prediction on rentals based on the information and models I have. My exploration and the analysis of the data will be performed in Python.

### Description of Dataset :
This dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.
Both hour.csv and day.csv have the following fields, except hr which is not available in day.csv

1. instant : record index

2. dteday : date

3. season : season (1:winter, 2:spring, 3:summer, 4:fall)

4. yr : year (0: 2011, 1:2012)

5. mnth : month ( 1 to 12)

6. hr : hour (0 to 23)

7. holiday : weather day is holiday or not (extracted from [Web Link])

8. weekday : day of the week

9. workingday : if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.

10. weathersit :

  1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
  2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
  3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
  4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog

11. temp : Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min), t_min=-8, t_max=+39 (only in hourly scale)

12. atemp : Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min), t_min=-16, t_max=+50 (only in hourly scale)

13. hum : Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)

14. windspeed : Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max)

15. casual : count of casual users

16. registered : count of registered users

17. cnt : count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered
